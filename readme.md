## Project to fetch data and display 20 transactions at a time using animations


What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why? 

I chose MongoDB NOSQL database. I chose this because it is a document based database and I was dealing with a large dataset. It made
my project efficient as there was no relational aggregation needed. Besides, relational database development is time consuming. I chose
MongoDB over any other NOSQL because the API is simpler and fast. 

What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why? 

JQuery was the easiest part because I have experience working with it and I did not have to change the code from first project.

What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why? 

I struggled with the ajax call to cross origin. I did not now about this concept earlier. Thus while 
fetching data one by one it was not allowing access to it.
 Even trying different solutions didn't get the problem fix. In the end, I changed to ajax call to controller.


If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?


My biggest concern would be to keep the code quality high since we are making use of multiple technologies
it tends to become bloated. I will take time every now and then to refactor my code.
